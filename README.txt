[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library.

The bot's main purpose is to play music on command.
The bot also has other little utilities such as rolling a dice based on user input.

About:
PlantBot was created due to constant outages in public discord bots & due to self-hosted bots having so much features that it hurts the customizability of the bot.
This bot is not meant for regular users, as it requires at minimum the basic knowledge of python progamming language.
